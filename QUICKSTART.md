# Quick Start

## Using MCU Crates

You can use a MCU crate directly. You will need to use cortex-m-rt as your runtime, as well as a panic crate.

## Using Board Crates

Board crates include a runtime and tools to make development easier including a serial console, dynamic clock,
dynamic interrupt dispatcher, and basic heap.
