# Goals

> If a problem cannot be solved, enlarge it. - Dwight D. Eisenhower

Bobbin SDK aims to provide a modern cross-platform software development platform for embedded
development using the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) programming language. This is a combination
of several elements:

- Board, MCU and Peripheral Description Language
- Board and MCU Support Crates
- Peripheral and Channel Device Drivers
- Clock and Power State Management Device Drivers
- Shared Filesystem and Networking Stacks
- Task Management and IPC Infrastructure
- Build-time Pin and Channel Validation
- Flash Loading, Debugging, and Testing Tools
- Documentation and Example Code for Board, MCU, and portable applications.

The SDK should be a resource for finding in a single place everything needed to start developing an embedded application from a documented, well tested base.
